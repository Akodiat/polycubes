%\subsection*{Personal}

%This is where you thank your advisor, colleagues, and family and friends.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisors, Professor Andrew Turberfield and Professor Ard Louis, for all their help, knowledge, and support, and for giving me this opportunity to begin with. Andrew has provided sound and rational advice whenever I have needed, helping me to ensure the scientific relevance of my work and making sure I focus on what is important. Likewise, Ard has provided much appreciated inspiration and ideas for new research directions and collaborations.

I would also like to thank Professor Petr {\v{S}}ulc, at Arizona State University, for his advice and guidance concerning oxView development, patchy particle simulation, as well as oxRNA. The secondment I spent in the {\v{S}}ulc group was a very valuable and productive time. Similarly, I would also like to thank Prof. Ebbe Andersen at Aarhus University for welcoming me during my secondment in his group and for introducing me to RNA origami.

I am also very thankful to the other members of my group; Dr Jonathan Bath, Rafael Carrascosa Marzo

%\subsection*{Institutional}

%If you want to separate out your thanks for funding and institutional support, I don't think there's any rule against it.  Of course, you could also just remove the subsections and do one big traditional acknowledgement section.
