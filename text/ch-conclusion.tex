\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, nanostructures self-assembly design has been investigated on both an abstract and a more detailed level. The presented projects have resulted in tools and methods for creating, simulating and analysing self-limiting modular structures with minimal complexity, potentially containing building blocks created in different design software.

Staged assembly

Given a maximum complexity - for example, a limited number of possible colours - what is the largest bounded structure that can deterministically assemble?
