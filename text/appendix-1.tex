\subsection{Python}
In order to speedup sampling, the c++ binary can be called multiple times in parallell and merged with the merge python script. For the results covered in Chapter \ref{ch:polycubes1}, the sampling was done on 100 concurrent nodes and merged.

The largest sampling done, the polyomino reference with 1e9 samples (described in Section \ref{sec:refcalc}), took a total of 72 hours, 57 minutes and 58 seconds to sample with 100 copies each performing 1e7 samples in parallel. The merging script then took another 197 hours, 40 minutes and 24 seconds to run, but it clearly saved a significant amount of time compared to running a single sampling for 100 times longer (which would take almost 7300 hours, or 304 days).

Finally the analysis script took another 301 hours, 44 minutes and 17 seconds to run.

took 359 hours, 9 minutes and 44 seconds

\chapter{The oxView codebase}

The code for oxView can be found at \url{https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna-viewer}. It is written in TypeScript and compiled into JavaScript. The 3D visualisation is done with the help of the Three.js library, while the graphical user interface uses the Metro 4. 

To compile, you need both typescript and Node.js installed. Typing \verb|npm install| should install all required node modules.

Type \verb|tsc| to compile.
