\chapter{The oxView codebase}

The code for oxView can be found at \url{https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna-viewer}. It is written in TypeScript and compiled into JavaScript. The 3D visualisation is done with the help of the Three.js library, while the graphical user interface uses the Metro 4. 

To compile, you need both typescript and Node.js installed. Typing \verb|npm install| should install all required node modules.

Type \verb|tsc| to compile.
