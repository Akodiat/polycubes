# C++ implementation of polycubes

Simply call `./build.sh` to build polycube binaries
It is then recommended to create subdirectory `mkdir out` and to call `../bin/polycubes --help` from there

To build python bindings, call `./build_pybind.sh` and make sure you have the pybind python module installed.
